## Learning Objectives:bulb:
What you should learn from this project:

* What are nested loops and how to use them
* What is a function and how do you use functions
* What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function
* What is a prototype
* Scope of variables
* What are the gcc flags -Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89
* What are header files and how to to use them with #include
   
## Tasks:notebook:  
   
* `0-isupper.c`: write a function that checks for uppercase character  
* `1-isdigit.c`: write a function that checks for a digit (0 through 9)  
* `2-mul.c`: write a function that multiplies two integers  
* `3-print_numbers.c`: write a function that prints the numbers `0` to `9` followed by a new line  
* `4-print_most_numbers.c`: write a function that prints the numbers `0` to `9` but not `2` and `4` followed by a new line  
* `5-more_numbers.c`: write a function that prints 10 times the numbers `0` to `14` followed by a new line  
* `6-print_line.c`: write a function that draws a straight line in the terminal  
* `
  7-print_diagonal.c`: write a function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal  
* `8-print_square.c`: write a function that prints a square followed by a new line  
* `9-fizz_buzz.c`: write a program that prints the numbers from `1` to `100` followed by a new line but for multiples of three print `Fizz` instead of the number and for multiples of five print `Buzz` and for numbers which are multiples of both three and five print `FizzBuzz`  
* `10-print_triangle.c`: write a function that prints a single triangle followed by a new line
