## Learning Objectives:bulb:
What you should learn from this project:

* What are function pointers and how to use them
* What does a function pointer exactly hold
* Where does a function pointer point to in the virtual memory

## Tasks:notebook:  
  
* `0-print_name.c`: write a function that prints a name  
* `1-array_iterator.c`: write a function that executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array  
* `2-int_index.c`: write a function that searches for an integer  
* `3-op_functions, 3-get_op_func.c, 3-calc.h`: write a program that performs simple operations
