* What is an entry point
* What is main
* How to print text using printf, puts and putchar
* How to get the size of a specific type using the unary operator sizeof

## Tasks:notebook:  
   
* `0-preprocessor`: write a script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result in another file  
* `1-compiler`: write a script that compiles a C file but does not link  
* `2-assembler`: write a script that generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file  
* `3-name`: write a script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named `cisfun`  
* `4-putc.c`: write a C program that prints exactly `"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle` followed by a new line  
* `5-printf.c`: write a C program that prints exactly `with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,` followed by a new line  
* `6-size.c`: write a C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on
