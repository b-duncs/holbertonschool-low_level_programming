## Learning Objectives:bulb:
What you should learn from this project:

* What is the difference between automatic and dynamic allocation
* What is malloc and free and how to use them
* Why and when use malloc
* How to use valgrind to check for memory leak

## Tasks:notebook:  
  
* `0-create_array.c`: write a function that creates an array of chars, and initializes it with a specific char  
* `1-strdup.c`: write a function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter  
* `2-str_concat.c`: write a function that concatenates two strings  
* `3-alloc_grid.c`: write a function that returns a pointer to a two dimensional array of integers  
* `4-free_grid.c`: write a function that frees a two dimensional grid previously created by your `alloc_grid` function
