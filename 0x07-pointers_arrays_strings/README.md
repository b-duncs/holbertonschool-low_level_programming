## Learning Objectives:bulb:
What you should learn from this project:

* What are pointers to pointers and how to use them
* What are multidimensional arrays and how to use them
* What are the most common C standard library functions to manipulate strings
  
## Tasks:notebook:  
  
* `0-memset.c`: write a function that fills memory with a constant byte  
* `1-memcpy.c`: write a function that copies memory area  
* `2-strchr.c`: write a function taht locates a character in a string  
* `3-strspn.c`: write a function that gets the length of a prefix substring  
* `4-strpbrk.c`: write a function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes  
* `5-strstr.c`: write a function that locates a substring  
* `7-print_chessboard.c`: write a function that prints the chessboard  
* `8-print_diagsums.c`: write a function that prints the sum of two diagonals of a square matrix of integers
