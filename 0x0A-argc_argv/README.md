## Learning Objectives:bulb:
What you should learn from this project:

* How to use arguments passed to your program
* What are two prototypes of main that you know of, and in which case do you use one or the other
* How to use __attribute__((unused)) or (void) to compile functions with unused variables or parameters

## Tasks:notebook:  
  
* `0-whatsmyname.c`: write a program that prints a name followed by a new line  
* `1-args.c`: write a program that prints the number of arguments passed into it  
* `2-args.c`: write a program that prints all arguments it receives  
* `3-mul.c`: write a program that multiplies two numbers  
* `4-add.c`: write a program that adds positive numbers
