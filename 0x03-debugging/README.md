## Learning Objectives:bulb:
What you should learn from this project:

* What is debugging
* What are some methods of debugging manually
* How to read the error messages
  
## Tasks:notebook:  
   
* '0-main.c', 'main.h': based on the 'main.c' file above, create a file named '0-main.c' and test that the function 'positive_or_negative()' gives the correct output when given a case of '0'  
* '1-main.c': copy this main file and comment out the part of code that is causing the output to go into an infinte loop  
* '2-largest-number.c', 'main.h': fix the code in '2-largest_number.c' so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case  
* '3-print_remaining_days.c', 'main.h': fix the 'print_remaining_days()' function so taht the output works correctly for *all* dates and *all* leap years
