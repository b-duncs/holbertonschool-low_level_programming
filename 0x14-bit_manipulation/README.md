## Learning Objectives:bulb:
What you should learn from this project:

* Look for the right source of information without too much help        
* How to manipulate bits and use bitwise operators   

## Tasks:notebook:  

* `0-binary_to_uint.c`: write a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int   
* `1-print_binary.c`: write a function that prints the binary representation of a number   
* `2-get_bit.c`: write a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index   
* `3-set_bit.c`: write a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index   
* `4-clear_bit.c`: write a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index   
* `5-flip_bits.c`: write a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another
