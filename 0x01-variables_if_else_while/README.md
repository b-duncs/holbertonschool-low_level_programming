## Tasks:notebook:   
   
* `0-positive_or_negative.c`: complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable `n` is positive or negative  
* `1-last_digit.c`: complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in variable `n`  
* `2-print_alphabet.c`: write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase  
* `3-print_alphanets.c`: write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase  
* `4-print_alphabt.c`: write a program that prints the alphabet (all letters except `q` and `e`) in lowercase  
* `5-print_numbers.c`: write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from `0`  
* `6-print_numberz.c`: write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from `0` (cannot use any variable of type `char`)  
* `7-print_tebahpla.c`: write a program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse  
* `8-print_base16.c`: write a program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase  
* `9-print_comb.c`: write a program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers
