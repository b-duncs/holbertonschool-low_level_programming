## Learning Objectives:bulb:
What you should learn from this project:

* What are pointers and how to use them
* What are arrays and how to use them
* What are the differences between pointers and arrays
* How to use strings and how to manipulate them
* Scope of variables
  
## Tasks:notebook:  
  
* `0-reset_to_98.c`: write a function that takes a pointer to an `int` as parameter and updates the value it points to `98`  
* `1-swap.c`: write a function that swaps the values of two integers  
* `2-strlen.c`: write a function that returns the length of a string  
* `3-puts.c`: write a function that prints a string followed by a new line to `stdout`  
* `4-print_rev.c`: write a function that prints a string in reverse followed ny a new line  
* `5-rev_string.c`: write a function that reverses a string  
* `6-puts2.c`: write a function that prints every other character of a string starting with the first character followed by a new line  
* `7-puts_half.c`: write a function that prints half of a string followed by a new line  
* `8-print_array.c`: write a function that prints `n` elements of an array of integers followed by a new line  
* `9-strcpy.c`: write a function that copies the string pointed to by `src` including the terminating null byte (`\0`) to the buffer pointed to by `dest`
