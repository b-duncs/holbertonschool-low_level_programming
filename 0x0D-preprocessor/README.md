## Learning Objectives:bulb:
What you should learn from this project:

* What are macros and how to use them
* What are the most common predefined macros
* How to include guard your header files

## Tasks:notebook:  
  
* `0-object_like_macro.h`: create a header file that defines a macro named `SIZE` as an abbreviation for the token `1024`  
* `1-pi.h`: create a header file that defines a macro name `PI` as an abbreviation for the token `3.14159265359`  
* `2-main.c`: write a program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from followed by a new line  
* `3-function_like_macro.h`: write a function-like macro `ABS(x)` that computes the absolute value of a number `x`  
* `4-sum.h`: write a function-like macro `SUM(x, y)` that computes the sum of the numbers `x` and `y`
