## Learning Objectives:bulb:
What you should learn from this project:

* What is a hash function   
* What makes a good hash function   
* What is a hash table, how do they work and how to use them   
* What is a collision and what are the main ways of dealing with collisions in the context of a hash table   
* What are the advantages and drawbacks of using hash tables   
* What are the most common use cases of hash tables   

## Tasks:notebook:  

* `0-hash_table_create.c`: write a function that creates a hash table   
* `1-djb2.c`: write a hash function implementing the djb2 algorithm   
* `2-key_index.c`: write a function that gives you the index of a key   
* `3-hash_table_set.c`: write a function that adds an element to the hash table   
* `4-hash_table_get.c`: write a function that retrieves a value associated with a key   
* `5-hash_table_print.c`: write a function that prints a hash table   
* `6-hash_table_delete.c`: write a function that deletes a hash table
