## Learning Objectives:bulb:
What you should learn from this project:

* What are nested loops and how to use them
* What is a function and how do you use functions
* What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function
* What is a prototype
* Scope of variables
* What are the gcc flags -Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89
* What are header files and how to to use them with #include
   
## Tasks:notebook:

* `1-alphabet.c`: write a function that prints the alphabet in lowercase  
* `2-print_alphabet_x10.c`: write a function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase  
* `3-islower.c`: write a function that checks for lowercase character  
* `4-isalpha.c`: write a function that checks for alphabetic character  
* `5-sign.c`: write a function that prints the sign of a number  
* `6-abs.c`: write a function that computes the absolute value of an integer  
* `7-print_last_digit.c`: write a function that prints the last digit of a numebr  
* `8-24_hours.c`: write a function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59  
* `9-times_table.c`: write a function that prints the 9 times table, starting with 0
